/raw contains generated limericks

- `free_form.txt` is generated by simply inputing <BOS> token
-- generated using standard LM as the reverse LM tends to directly output the first <LINE> immediately after <BOS>

- `free_form_5000.txt` is generated by simply inputting <BOS> token
-- generate first line using standard LM and then rest of limerick using reverse LM

- `once_upon_a_time.txt` is generated by inputting the first line "once a upon a time <LINE>"

- `sample.txt` is generated by using the first line from 100 sampled limericks, generating 50 new limericks for each line.
-- The actual number of limericks may be slightly off, as the model can sometimes generate limericks that do not have 5 lines (it's relatively rare though)
