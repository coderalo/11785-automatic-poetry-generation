it is part of god's clever design
it is structure, nature, design
how i love to the heart
before it's my start
i've just double-crossed on a vine

it is part of god's clever design
on your right leg?you might say, might be fine
what your left leg? some say
next?just take that ok
put your leg line it all round the line

it is part of god's clever design
for a word, or it's sure to combine
of a poem, a verse
but such words could be worse
but at least it goes out of the mind

it is part of god's clever design
actomorphic, it isn't benign
to the one that's divine
and divine in design
which in each of the two intertwine

it is part of god's clever design
god is human; but not by design
if he strikes me on you
then he strikes me on you
like my ass to his god, it's not mine

it is part of god's clever design
that's divine in god's heart; such design
me-god claims that he's
from his feet to his knees
he's too prayerless and hard to recline

it is part of god's clever design
its clever design, on each line
it's starching in lines
from ingenious designs
it's time!  that's without it. it's mine

it is part of god's clever design
it's cute, so my head's nine-point-nine
though it's winged on the line
that's no divine design
it's one fact that i'm as perfect as mine

it is part of god's clever design
from her eyes to her eyes, it's to shine
it shines in her light
to a thought that's a fright
when it's done in a charby design

it is part of god's clever design
and his name, seems divine, on his line
but one person knows
yes, in time that it goes
it's a place where no god would be mine

it is part of god's clever design
and its role is, on top of the line
but the roles part of god
keeps a promise or nod
is in place not to sit down to recline

it is part of god's clever design
for his worship of beauty? divine
for a god of the gods
so we're part of the gods
created by fools who are twine

it is part of god's clever design
and he seeks to describe the divine
is he simply divine
his life just is fine
it's something to fill down each line

it is part of god's clever design
i write verse in this limerick of mine
this word, yet i find
but it's not in my mind
read and write it as god of divine

it is part of god's clever design
to be played by this world; and like mine
my epithetes are puns
and i don't put on guns
not funny, and care not to dine

it is part of god's clever design
its symmetry and might intertwine
distributions align
and align or align
beyond goodness beyond god's design

it is part of god's clever design
what deities' clever design
used to put in the things
god has legs and has wings
there were yours but not mine, not mine

it is part of god's clever design
is a thing you can extend its design
and beyond all of things
what way manly brings
and when, in your life, you intertwine

it is part of god's clever design
to write verses, drawn forth in a line
in this biblical way
in both ways to convene
you'll be blessed in one way to divine

it is part of god's clever design
that is made in the clever design
i don't know that it's in
if it's f'less, it's thin
or it's thin? do not if you refine

it is part of god's clever design
stretched over the edge of the line
six six sides. made it clear
to be round-around here
i look up for my life. but it's mine

it is part of god's clever design
what is goodness we find that divine
it tempts me to see
who embarked on a spree
just my god, didn't lead him to shine

it is part of god's clever design
in good verse, god's inspired by design
but if there are two lines
or three lines, in two twines
and an anagram? a phrase and a line

it is part of god's clever design
on a board that's in grade twenty-nine
as design by design
they're a picture of mine
they're like cardboard, and don't so combine

it is part of god's clever design
that's artful, divine, by design
in his heart, just divine
with creations of mine
sure, his work is, by god, just like mine

it is part of god's clever design
to divinely part of clever design
just inspired this art
i and stare at my heart
yet i know that it's not in one line

it is part of god's clever design
in each kind of divine design
my devotion to you
god's devotion too
i'll do mine?you'll get wrong from the line

it is part of god's clever design
there's just three there's a line from the nine
all is part of a god
so you'll find it quite odd
would you think it is bigger than mine

it is part of god's clever design
such design, form of clever design
when the artist in art
i suppose he is smart
then i guess that i'll see his decline

it is part of god's clever design
by the method i need to refine
my god is divine
that this limerick is mine
which i found in my body.  divine

it is part of god's clever design
you drink wine?the same as colter, entwine
if you love it and think it
but then, frankly, drink it
the fruit of our love just is fine

it is part of god's clever design
with our efforts to show how they shine
as the word by design
the cataractine's fine
it's true.  then, by design

it is part of god's clever design
as high as a guy on the line
but try to reach out
if i hit him, i doubt
but she said he was really a twine

it is part of god's clever design
one of him, this just could be fine
by his mercy and grace
let them love to embrace
yes, you're mine! you are mine, yours and mine

it is part of god's clever design
that object of agin's design
when he's pleasing to see
and it's better than thee
so about thee? no, god would decline

it is part of god's clever design
every one and the two is all nine
one in three or in two
in a line that is true
they're apart, one in two, by design

it is part of god's clever design
it is useful, it seems, to design
and riveting and screwing
with wood, and it's screwing
may need, but this screwing's just fine

it is part of god's clever design
to try living in; really, it's fine
if what work's made by you
being linked to it, too
works well if you start to work online

it is part of god's clever design
and his ego he tends to decline
i admit he looks great
because nothing of late
and is eager to take over wine

it is part of god's clever design
or, for you, to bring things down to spine
but all, upon you
boosting upon you too
is a pain in your deferent spine

it is part of god's clever design
just like men who, divine, intertwine
to a god, who is great
and be glorified, mate
and appear to be very divine

it is part of god's clever design
has no eye, and it's not in the spine
but you wear it if not
where you wear it a lot
and make some others eager to learn

it is part of god's clever design
looks divine, but it's less than design
if it's human, it's true
who will give it to you
that, before me, most gods seem divine

it is part of god's clever design
it is sinless. good lord, it's divine
every aspect of god
is to give this young sod
do we love him, but while we recline

it is part of god's clever design
of every design on this line
they think lilies are fine
to a man who's divine
so they're beautiful? ladies, don't twine

it is part of god's clever design
of creatures like ravens and tin
he's an animal beast
(or at least) when they feast
or some goat, or some lamb, or some kin

it is part of god's clever design
that's the time when it's done with the line
i axinomatize, see
should belong to the tree
so don't say what it is, by design

it is part of god's clever design
but it's part of god's clever design
if you do it, and know
some believe me, will grow
for a lift from your cradle of mine

it is part of god's clever design
he wouldn't make it, i'm told, would be fine
an intelligent, wise man
as a bowler, his plan
drinks a drink from the bottle of wine

it is part of god's clever design
for my god, it's designed to define
within each, every word
from the english i've heard
is on right, up and down every line

on the lines and my rhymes tend to trim
little limericks are lines
electrocomic designs

in my lifetime i've had two epiphanies
that tightness has brought me for crannies
with my buttons (they're tight
watch me night, day and night
for my comfort: the word is for dannies

in my lifetime i've had two epiphanies
both old dogs, and systrokes, and dulchias
they lives on their drawers
digies, studs, and more drawers
this history says:

in my lifetime i've had two epiphanies
for this small maple tree's called fellas
it's as thick as a wood
showing tall, this is good
of the northernmost species called fellas

in my lifetime i've had two epiphanies
a long past?one of all antiquities
but a long time ago
took my time!  don't you know
is the one of such grand antiquities

in my lifetime i've had two epiphanies
their time out. so, today, in the swanas
there's the first one that i
they must catch me, and fly
although now you say it is called bikhani

in my lifetime i've had two epiphanies
i've decided to live on my rannies
for the old age one
so i'll have to have fun
and i'm sure i'm not drunk at the grannies

in my lifetime i've had two epiphanies
haven't married! i've lost lots of khanies
advantage, you'll see
they were both, now and me
when i asked,

in my lifetime i've had two epiphanies
that both lives in lowland in yaias
i will eat every day
'round, back and away
eat me right there in tongs and in tas

in my lifetime i've had two epiphanies
and rages, crannies and craniies
i've got two sardinesis
and tarzaniasis
with only twelve sleepers, daisies

in my lifetime i've had two epiphanies
they tell me of autokinesis
this word that's not mean
at my daily routine
they're not thinking it's causing me wannies

in my lifetime i've had two epiphanies
of towns where i lived on the bannies
in new england, and more
would survive the old bore
the six now are bannulled.  yeah, monohannies

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
at its centerpoint, neatly defined
when totality's the point
shows the scientist's chart
of the earth.  it's too-simply defined

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
to avoid the eclipse of a mind
for the very same time
an image sublime
at two times, it's always entwined

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
as the celestial body's aligned
lots of light on the sun
and when everything's done
i can't think i've gone out of my mind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
at its surface at stars nicely entwined
the moon's brightness can show
as for earth's newton's glow
as pure beauty lies shrouded in mind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
to the moon; it must be intertwined
but a total eclipse
is a total eclipse
just avoid it, so make it my mind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
around earth, with a mark that's deigned
about every new year
i say jesus is here
thus we call all our earth to mankind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
as the parts of the earth are maligned
every solar eclipse
that, until it enlarges
indigestion to most of mankind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
now all over: the years been maligned
we've no light left around
that's intense, profound
every season predicts how the sun shone

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
at its place in the sun: so aligned
from the east to the north
where the clouds have passed forth
i can say it shines bright on their mind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
this eclipse may be hidden behind
plus, the darkness, the skies
between earth, both the eyes
and the world has been neatly defined

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
all her body's in space; she's maligned
due to solar eclipse
through an ancient greece
see, she left her own moon left behind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
yes, our planet's horizon's defined
up at night; it can see
past the heavens there may be
while the heavens are clearly aligned

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
but a eclipse when the earth is entwined
an elliptical sight
when the earth's moon is bright
there is its moonlight: shrouded behind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
at celestial orbit's moon, so aligned
an observer's view
would refer to the blue
that describes it: the star, still in mind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
to align to the sun, as defined
for an eclipse in two
(though it seems that's much to do)
that the sun's effect is undermined

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
left so far from earth's light. it's maligned
and then black (a dark point)
till the moon's just one bright point
(south and north, the sun is inclined)

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
at a point where the earth was entwined
for a solar eclipse
of the sun. now i surmise
but the earth's been so blind and so blind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
with no pole-point, too aptly defined
to a view from the sun
and it's pretty well done
it so far that goes back in my mind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
so our stars are all neatly defined
and descend to the sun
an eclipse is just one
you're get out and get out of your mind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
to observe that eclipse that's maligned
a most solar eclipse
an old nudist's purses
a tenuous eclipse of a kind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
anectally means it aligned
but you'll find that it's true
the newtonian moon, too
that the earth is a bit too-inclined

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
is to see in the sky and in mind
but at all we are seen
to the stars, red to green
they'll be seeing they're only behind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
time is round, but the time's quite aligned
but if you can see
as you know it will be
in that place where the circle you'll find

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
non-opportunities seem to be vexed
and the rest of the earth
is, at times, of its birth
long before, in the sun, is it next

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
makes it clear that the horizon's entwined
it's most likely to see
but the way it can be
thus its angles are slightly inclined

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
the horizon, the weather's designed
many hours at night
to the heavens, it's bright
to me, summer lovers unwind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
at off top of the lines i defined
the consequent?an eclipse
the eclipse that i choose
i thought i was totally blind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
in midlate (east or north) of night. it's maligned
this faint solar eclipse
its apparent success
because, even now, here it's for long

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
made of disk, star, or light that's maligned
every solar eclipse
is to greater or less
(till the choyupus shows us) was born

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
where the sun points are closely aligned
while the eclipse point in line
may appear to be fine
when they're jogbled by moonlight or blind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
but the summertime's not 'round my mind
the most of its eclipse
that no moon hit or miss
will appear on the globe, westward, inclined

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
when circles are perfectly inclined
a point in the sun's sun
but at night, when it's done
and no faint cloud cloud is starting to burst

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
to earth's maximum angle assigned
the path long and clear
near each lunar sphere
which, chronically axially traced

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
of when we're ephemeral and kind
for this year in its years
that each brightness appears
and ephemeral, as which you will find

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
with stars that are lost and entwined
this day?  this is a sign
wears a sign that is fine
though it's cold, we were lodgled behind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
with our planets signively slightly aligned
by some planets in space
and a very high place
all we hope that we know they're behind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
for the guy who was, sadly, maligned
an eclipse from that place
and he fell to the case
of marsupus: in eclipse combined

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
an eclipse that is barely designed
when a sight you can miss it
oh, you're lucky!  you miss it
try to orbit the earth in your mind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
that your child will be mourningly blind
it is not at its time
far away at the time
i'm afraid it won't hurt if you mind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
this orb bright, and round you inclined
should we see you, in there
from the world we will stare
for this creature whose nature is blind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
then eclipse have new points assigned
when the stars are in place
their horizon's under the face
let the sun and the stars make up the line

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
anatomical stars we're defined
no matter from light
on a cone full of night
all our eyes cried,

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
at a place that was different in kind
it orbits the moon
early or not very soon
and quite lucky for seeing it burst

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
that eclipse bright as can be defined
from the scopes in the skies
of bright locus, sun's size
i can see and our stars are aligned

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
to each side of the sun aligned
since the time on the sphere
in each planet is clear
its motion is clear, seem well-assigned

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
near the point where the center's aligned
so, when the sun's in sight
in a region of light
that it's not for this earth, not inclined

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
that eclipse with the earth is maligned
though the centitude shows
at three hundred and six
i'd cast all of our earth to mankind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
while our planet goes out of your mind
that our sun's not around
that the sun won't be bound
or our sunshine has vanished behind

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
this refers to a star that's defined
but it's not how it shows
so on earth, as it knows
you don't see what is clearly maligned

the eclipse year's too-simply defined
and so clear it is perfectly aligned
now this circle takes place
and shows it apace
we will find with our planets consigned

so i'm thinking of taking up booze

a clownish performer will use
for a cockney, or clown, with abuse
for a job as a clown
is it best to put down
if you're dressed for a guy in his shoes

a clownish performer will use
on a ride or a bus, or a cruise
to run off, on the street
that the fish you must eat
so just slap him, please go for his blues

a clownish performer will use
in his word (this old name for a goose)
is a bit of a joke
for the ones that they seek
of his clowners; both picky and morose

a clownish performer will use
using lighting and sound that's profuse
to amuse in the crowd
they will cheer him out loud
(and those bassos? my gosh? they refuse!

a clownish performer will use
from his nose to his face is profuse
one might think, to be lewd
as the ladies all nude
a performance i'd never confuse

a clownish performer will use
with no reference to feminine cues
alternation? no, he
and you'll like it to see
is a trick that the ladies all use

the old basalt is low
in that mountain, the soles of the seas

far too close to my baby's head
or far better, you see
in a room filled with glee
it's when crammed in six sacks of bread

anomia fills me with dread
or three problems at hospital bed
but each morning, i'll cry
and i'm wondering why
'cause i'm not in my way to my head

anomia fills me with dread
he loves me, and he saves me, instead
as he drives me to death
but pulls over my breath
but his deathlessness fills me with dread

anomia fills me with dread
with a shortage of blood fills my head
i've developed a clot
which is certainly not

and it keeps you from out in your head

anomia fills me with dread
i should not think that pills in my head
but sometimes i'll take it
and sometimes i'll take it
with pills 'cause i die 'til i'm dead

anomia fills me with dread
you must quit it again, if you're dead
it was time before death
hadn't last out my breath
so what's it on me?before you've been fed

anomia fills me with dread
as i sit at the top of my head
so my doctor says that i
how i fear i might die
is it wrong, and it still leaves me dead

anomia fills me with dread
as i grow on the shape of a head
and i'm sure there's a nose
to my skin, i suppose
i am sure that my head should be dead

anomia fills me with dread
and that's why i feel flat on my head
all those headaches, i know
antomophobia's foe
but i haven't the doctor said

anomia fills me with dread
i'm pregnant! i'd cut off your head
my mom couldn't care
was i wearing no hair
that young mom with a baby instead

anomia fills me with dread
so i'm texting on phone and in bed
that it leads to my way
could be worse, i would say
that each line is turned out of my head

anomia fills me with dread
if he thinks that my baby are dead
then as if he's deep in it
his voice is minute
he's dead. can you say what he said

anomia fills me with dread
with the insects from out of the spread
of the insects, i find
aniferous kind
and the lotions that take them to bed

anomia fills me with dread
and i suffer a lump on my head
although fever is swell
and the doctor would tell
i should treat it? which is why i'm dead

it's an entomia, instead
menitis? for me it's
there's no diagnosis
the one that i said i were dead

or the wings of the plane
not like capsules? a train
in my dream?? it's just down in my bed

anomia fills me with dread
there's a woman who beats me, ahead
i try dating a guy
as i stare through the sky
she's a woman who beats me, ahead

anomia fills me with dread
and the barium fills up my head
the barerium fills me
this infection will kill me
but i fear, i'm just dreading instead

anomia fills me with dread
sleeps lull me asleep on her bed
though i'm curled in the bed
in her pillowy head
it's both depression and dread

anomia fills me with dread
looking off with a woman, instead
she's part of his life
but goes back with the wife
much better than water, instead

anomia fills me with dread
with a swollen, large swollen head
the pain to its flatness
is swollen with flatness
it's agacilloma, instead

anomia fills me with dread
but my sleep doesn't fill up in bed
they put tears to my head
so i hold them in bed
though i think that i'm really well fed

anomia fills me with dread
but when my poor skull hits my head
don't think that my brain's
there are things in my brains
if they're gone? i may well end up dead

anomia fills me with dread
when a girlfriend should just go to bed
anomia, i'd say
is to join me today
though i'm satanomia, i dread

anomia fills me with dread
embezzled, and out of her head
but a mermaid, who's in it
and into the closet
when i see her, i think i'm a dead

anomia fills me with dread
has forced me to sleep here in bed
or a pillow in bed
it has ants on my head
like a nightmare by sucking my head

anomia fills me with dread
when these headaches go down in my head
disapprelates me
my solution awaits me
and a symptom fills me with dread

anomia fills me with dread
that covers my head 'round my head
what i find in the mints
the south asian skitt's
and it blooms to the flowers of red

anomia fills me with dread
such conceisiness: something that's dead
if my jaw's full of nervousness
such queosiness, nervousness
('nares me, i'll end in a thread

anomia fills me with dread
take a girl, take a look at my head
i'm inclined to be in it
you sit in the closet
to a front-room, and take to my bed

anomia fills me with dread
that my kids and my plans are interred
after shopping all day
for you can't help me, ay
too busy on shopping instead

anomia fills me with dread
that wiggles my mind; but instead
or controlling my mind
when i see my behind
i forget 'til my memory's gone dead

anomia fills me with dread
with that bowlful of food that is plaid
my stomach is lumpy
my stomach gets lumpy
then i come before i get dead

anomia fills me with dread
growing out of my grandmother's head
when coming back, i can see her
looking back; it will free her
we'll never come out of her spread

anomia fills me with dread
that my light they are shed, so they're shed
when i dust it with air
if i try it, take care
my deodorant might send me to bed

anomia fills me with dread
my laziness leaves me in bed
it's like molding my head
i see beasties instead
and laziness fills me with dread

anomia fills me with dread
it won't help; i won't sleep in the dead
i'm not living in sleep
that is killing my sheep
so my sleep's in a hospital bed

anomia fills me with dread
i'm mercy of god; so i'm dead
i'm gone; here's in god
leaving life to life's odd
so i'm gone, so i don't move ahead

anomia fills me with dread
if i sat there in up on my head
but i think it's no pain
can't shut up my brain
if i miss it, i might think i'm dead

anomia fills me with dread
not just one in my brain on one's head
it is surely that you
there's the name of this brew
why cannot you find me?  you're dead

anomia fills me with dread
with a headache that's on my head
if you varnish, i feel
and the truth is surreal
if i'm gone, won't you tell me i'm dead

anomia fills me with dread
that i can't get it out of its head
still i'm sitting in bed
get it out on my head
though i seem to be cushy instead

anomia fills me with dread
of tears, and the feelings of dread
but it's love, and i feel
my new love is real
i have something from parents i've had

anomia fills me with dread
though to me i am far ahead
i don't worry or fear
it may never come near
i'm still living, you know that i'm dead

anomia fills me with dread
it's a meaning i've probably read
if i do it by night
take to bed for my sight
i will not feel an itch in the head

anomia fills me with dread
in this proctologist's head
as his mucus and tells me
to his doc, it instills me
the doctor said

anomia fills me with dread
as its color and hue leaves me red
as i'm purple or pink
is a pigment, i think
but not hair dye, should i mention the med

anomia fills me with dread
when i bring you to bed, just in bed
she will join you and me
she will join you and me
to be living inside me, she's dead

that my vision is way into viewing

can't believe what i'm hearing and seeing
with controlling the mind that i'm viewing
i'll be going like hell

there's no lightning, no space
keep your head for the place

on, of course, the white screen
what looks darned?it's obscuring, uncaring

that describe all the things i've been seeing
if the nerves are aligning
my hearing and singing

though it's perfectly clear
it isn't near it gets near
how i hope you be nearer than fleeing

can't believe what i'm hearing and seeing
double-sightedness leads me to crying
to the point of my hearing
with vision so frightening
ok, let's be deaf; there's no denying

autodontophobia's cure

the balusters hold up the rail
if it falls (if you fall) on the rail
so just use them for you
should place over there, too
then your boat should have failed to prevail

the balusters hold up the rail
set on ropes, just like cable and rail
on the heads, they pull rail
raising arms, they pull rail
lets them hold or in place without harm

the balusters hold up the rail
to train, harness, cable and rail
the way, if you're able
of dieselane and cable
be safe from which harness won't fail

the balusters hold up the rail
or lift it as fast as its trail
the train is a drag
without pulling its brag
with a slow-moving train without fail

the balusters hold up the rail
acceleration brings minimal harm
to balance and speed
to allow them you need
or you're holding your arm on your arm

the balusters hold up the rail
for the driver, unable to rail
it will lift on your boat
with no power. just hope
you'll wind up?that allows it to sail

the balusters hold up the rail
is towed to the cars; they won't derail
they can't handle just right
now the seats are so tight
and they shudder; they don't seem to stall

the balusters hold up the rail
when they let them stand down at the scale
that they've heard a loud sound
that fall out in the ground
while two timbers are out on the trail

the balusters hold up the rail
on a beam at each trunk and each rail
with the axial force
and this happens of course
which it's best that the train cannot fail

the balusters hold up the rail
but when floating, adrift in a whale
on the tankers there
on the waters they share
they both carry and carry the bill

the balusters hold up the rail
with passengers floating on mail
now afloat, to we sail
we can't handle that scale
and lift to a hold of our rail

the balusters hold up the rail
from a tower, the track, or the rail
it's used to control
to a tower or pole
and an airplane will not be the rail

the balusters hold up the rail
from the jerky and swift way to trail
bourned deep in the air
winded so grimly fair
lugging boggers, without hope, could prevail

the balusters hold up the rail
if their steamship doesn't derail
are attached to the crew
which they hold, through and through
are attached at the rail, without fail

the balusters hold up the rail
our ship's small, we just cannot appall
up, hold up, hold down
'cause with nary a frown
but that weight loss would seem easy to rail

the balusters hold up the rail
at the rail, where each side's on the rail
as they watch riders ride
and they watch horses ride
their wildeasters ride without fail

the balusters hold up the rail
to the crane-building ships; they avail
of cannon and boom
if you might have a room
overcost of insurance and bail

the balusters hold up the rail
will be going to train or to jail
they may hold in their jeers
into windows and doors
the-buster is hold, without fail

the balusters hold up the rail
on the railroad, they stand by the rail
not the bars, but the rails
that their train never fails
in fact, even a railsman's on jail

the balusters hold up the rail
their machines are so feeble and frail
but the tubes in the air
lead to someone who's there
are for sure we'll be holding a rail

the balusters hold up the rail
they stand keeping safe while each fall
having lost all their power
that can hold them each hour
to act, thus disregarding the ball

the balusters hold up the rail
they won't push them to rocks, till they fail
they deliver such force
to their grasp or of course
like the trunks of their ship? they take bail

the balusters hold up the rail
of a boat that will sometimes cause harm
on the edge of the decks
and be bound to the canes
(that they swing to your sails with an arm)

the balusters hold up the rail
a collection of whales and a whale
though we listen to sound
these dolphins are found
set away to their times without fail

the balusters hold up the rail
drop it off, there's the absence of charm
you can give it a lift
or your face would besmirch
and your bismarlock would quickly disarm

the balusters hold up the rail
that one's armless and plundered and pale
which seems such a fooling
that wouldn't be drowning
is in under gravity's scale

the balusters hold up the rail
set on ropes, or they pull in the rail
at the end of the train
be it dinghy or plain
pull together, and pull out the rail

the balusters hold up the rail
like ropes, on their side, hold up the rail
at the end of each boat's
(of a boat that has spats
the damper has sails, well as the rail)

the balusters hold up the rail
they float up and sail down the trail
carry under the rail
then they land on the rail
and a basket of sail, without fail

the balusters hold up the rail
take the ship in a trip to the rail
where the liquors hold
they will go with the gold
with the way that the captain prevail

the balusters hold up the rail
if you take 'em on causing no harm
to your ship on the sail
that will help you with rail
but the cost of its loss is real harm

the balusters hold up the rail
in the hope that a train doesn't pass
except for its ride
it will safely subside
the way down to the front of a rail

the balusters hold up the rail
but your boats, and, on top, are all frail
but if they're engrossed
are not to be lost
carry up, you are still on the rail

the balusters hold up the rail
hung across and beyond all the charm
as they hold up the rail
that won't harm you, alas
if you cross yourself, grab an arm

the balusters hold up the rail
where the sailors down under the rail
first latch up, and then pass
the rail is first class
stay aboard, though they just shouldn't fail

the balusters hold up the rail
be having a ride on the rail
just hold forward.  you sail
and sail down in their gale
that's the rail, up and down, down on the rail

the balusters hold up the rail
and a rail that sailors can't rail
(it's also called rail)
that sailors can't sail
i'm afraid they can't pay a bail

the balusters hold up the rail
lift it up, they allow us to gale
holding together, there
we will come to despair
in the hand of the train at the rail

the balusters hold up the rail
and climb over here on the trail
of their safety, my dreads
that are tough to have runs
and will stand where you have to retrail

the balusters hold up the rail
are they surfing or swims from the barge
in the rocks, floating down
or paddle or drown
from the ship at the end of a lag

the balusters hold up the rail
to the docks where they ride on the rail
full of gravity's lift
to come down with the lift
as the wheels turn, on and onto the rail

the balusters hold up the rail
but it's close to the rail for the rail
hold each tug by your arm
(and some muscles for harm
as the joint for your arm, makes it frail)

the balusters hold up the rail
to the front, they hang under the rail
their sails, arms tied up
raise a lift from the cup
built for pullers, held back down the rail

the balusters hold up the rail
all the trees or the cars on the rail
it has no place to pass on
so please grab your ass on
it keeps you from texas in jail

the balusters hold up the rail
that galleons set off of a barge
when they steers ashore
under rocks from their gear
all are under their masts, by and large

the balusters hold up the rail
from this system they'll never avail
add an air pressure high
see the pilot, and spy
to the tower, in which we can't rail

the balusters hold up the rail
those wannings that cause no alarm
with thundering urns
as when fires cause surns
a storm will occasion no harm

the balusters hold up the rail
stay short, they stay strong, and let's sail
at so long, let them float
go get towed to a boat
when you're eager to get to the rail

the balusters hold up the rail
in a tug on your harness, don't rail
and if you can't rail
but if you can't rail
things may help?i've some hope it won't fail

the balusters hold up the rail
with airbells thickly mounted, too tall
and overhead bars, overhead
i'm afraid they are dead
(since they're much more useless at all)

the best tea is a brew
that's the same when the malt comes from straight

all my boughs. disgusting food is, mate
but, for you, you're sweet
and it's pudding i eat
'til enough. it's the right on my plate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
but my tea is so bad one you ate
you'll still tell what i mean
(keep the juice in a bean
i'll go chaste now? the most fruit you'll abate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
and they served me of lunch! hit my plate
some entrails, lemons and greens
such as caustiness means
were the pigments and food that i ate

i think i've a reason of late
so it's food that i eat
nor no veggies, not meat
and has turned up the food that i ate

and so now i taste great
my year's cup cup. the phobics all ate

this is not, since it sits on my plate
i've a sweet cup of tea
though i'm smooth, sugar-free
without sugar now! i've gained weight

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
i believe that the prices are great
but i had better buy
there i drank, by and by
so i dropped by the tea on my plate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
it's just not in this tea?i will wait
its name is great tea
but the people at sea
they've latched up in that order i hate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
of the liquid that's added in weight
to make a nice drink
but it's likely to think
or complain when it's bitter, it's great

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
so i'll wait for more tea on me straight
at my fridge i sat down
though it's fragrant and brown
my staff filled it up in the heat

'cause the mood is a flatter of late
but it's time for my drinkin'
i ain't had to sink in
or you'll find i, of course, alkalomate

when i drink it with haste, loss of weight

but the total my people will rate
i eat meat and a drink
turns right off, so i think

oil and flour in your beans won't taste great
have some grease on your beans
and sprinkle your greens
or might go on a drip off your plate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
so all people are here, but i hate
i've a few cups of coffee
a few cups of toffee
shoeed up on the side of my plate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
even then i would say that of late
it, alas, will be late
to berate and inflate
though a chinochophobia's hate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
but the milk, people, done with no rate
is no need, oh, this milk
i'm afraid i'd have silk
there's no need to make milk that is great

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
what with glasses that taste really great
and it stays smooth and sweet
for producing great heat
and it brings a nice taste. there's one straight

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
now that makes the sweet cup i hate
but my love is a treat
and i'm sad, if i cheat
i can't eat it.  let's stay out of plate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
since it's known for its taste and its mate
but its word is known best
with each other: the rest
busy' best.  (that's an example of late)

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
after drinking, i'll be rather late
for the savor of tea
like a hot brandy, see
i'll continue to sit down my plate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
when i mention what's brewed by your plate
though i know that it's brewed
(there's a cup, and it's said)
for fermenting that's sure to taste great

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
of this cup filled up on my plate
with a flavor that that's nice
i suppose, for a vice
it's like tea that's confectionate, mate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
and my oedilfers don't look so great
i can make hot iced brown tea
make a smooth iced  brown tea
that? you can buy it?  god, what i hate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
this one's so capricious! but wait
joey chocolate, too
of this chocolatey brew
though it's black, though, it's just what i ate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
with salads, reducing this weight
make a cake that is bland
to calm down with my hand
add some lettuce, what's bad and what's great

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
drinking sugar is much like a mate
drs a pint of plain milk
but some may be pure silk
and its name you've distilled from your plate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
fed over one cup: that's that great
i don't care what i say
to enjoy it all day
though i'd drink up the way? it's not straight

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
take it nourish, or eat it! abate
i'll phosphate you
of making that stew
your food i will simply abate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
it's this one with some bread and milk, or, mate
if two christmas are nice
makes no change from this price
though the name is not amalgamish, mate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
with such fury!  i'll eat it with nate
i just cannot stir it
at least i can stir it
my friends call me betty! for sure

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
have some lettuce lined up on a plate
and i think it's all right
take a good bite and bite
when they're bland, and it isn't too late

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
from this order i just wouldn't rate
and to add for each cup
while fermenting them up
what i need is a little debate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
that's the last time, the hour of late
shut it out! make a clear
take no water. my dear
that's more now, it just ruined your date

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
now it tastes and tastes really great
and it's a devil's drink
and delicious, i think
and it's tasty, but not 'cause it's fate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
there's goodliness and frankness! that's great
with tea in my milk
it's a kind of turk
if you won't wash it up when i'm straight

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
and it's filled with dessert! what i hate
that the tea that i made
was a very fine shade
'twas a wonderful measure of weight

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
but what's coffee? that's not what i hate
not a small coffee cup
i shall brew it.  shut up
i brewed up, all that coffee i ate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
it's the right for that tea that i ate
still, the water from tea
is the sea from the sea
those who get all my food on my plate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
how to toast it with standings, they're great
(with crumbs and flour)
it's explosive in power
i can throw in the hot?no, wait

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
i must order the stuff, just so great
serve to get home or eat
make me tasty? so sweet
we decided to share what i ate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
when i'm drinking some drink.  oh, i hate
if i drink in the green
what hot chocolate has been
i buck up and i fail to abate

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
this tea's sissie's ready for spain
they have sugar that's brewed
without any old bread
to add water. it also is  great

this tea is an outrage! i'll state
that's me, sad to say? far too late
using sugar and milk
cream and cake cream and silk
is this treat for the stuff that i hate

birthdays, i hear, are septaneous
i'll tell you like things

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
prelectibleness seems extraneous
all remembered in me
what no longer can be
such events occur as extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
we're caused by some stuff that's extraneous
you may eat on some day
from the alternate way
such a meal that is, i'd say, extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
same birthday is rare and inexplicable
my son and my son
the same year. oh hey, son
in the same years?  yeah, they're all adenual

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
but brief, not extraneous extraneous
it's hard to have fun
as we still turn to sun
but use the same word, circumcutaneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
a bobber whose hair is cutaneous
in love, but i know
that he works on on a show
when it's done, just the same means, extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
we are nothing or nothing extraneous
i picked up, but i'll say
in an impeccable way
it was awkward; it might be extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
different birthday for one? not extraneous
though we're happy, i'd say
was the first of the day
with the star of the moon?  not extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
unlike, by some strange things, emporaneous
to our family day. see
just step out of your tree
some know now, so you're not not extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
please ask us?you're quite extemporaneous
she tells us each new date
the arrival of late
then tell us. at first, contemporaneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
each birthday. that all's extraneous
we'll become the same birthday
we know we're a-havin'
you'll all agree: we're incinitaneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
which we like, and they seem extraneous
my coableness is
when you're writing a thesis
ended up? that should not be extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
same birthday. it's not all exinaneous
same moments of life
without anger or strife
i love it in life, extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
about life. but it may be extraneous
yes, everyone's said it
since it hasn't a fit
is that there's so much intertemporaneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
i know the first part is extraneous
but when i came first
this i shouldn't be cursed
if you happen.  you're first, not extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
you mean that, say, they're not extricaneous
which mean the same thing
like a ring as a ring
and our parents? they're simply extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
<BOS> (unlike, or extraneous
but we're no longer alive
i'll run off; now i drive
to stay here?but it still seems extemporaneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
my events are too impressionaneous
they are so many days
makes my way to amaze
but my same birthday birth?  it's not 'taneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
has caused us to be more extraneous
a life full of fun
and we're quite like a ton
you can do it, but there's nothing extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
this same birth. it is quite extraneous
now they're twins?not at all
here they're called to the ball
though to me, life can be quite extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
same birthday? it's wholly extemporaneous
one birthday one day
looks much less than okay
large number of things contemporaneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
it's one in two words emporaneous
oh, you're the one
we should not be undone
if we make the same day: that's spontaneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
same dates? no, we're not self-letaneous
on the last one day start
can't be far from my heart
same sex, we are not intercutaneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
same date? sure, it's the date's initial
i was asking for two
was what he was on you
did i miss it? that's just the initial

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
while others are quite intemporaneous
some folks like to see
start with all, we're set free
lots of things that are hardly extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
was me shocked how your dates are extraneous
(though you're no-ness, you say
i'm exacting today
and my question is only extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
when we're born. the odd one is cutaneous
once we've been just one way
but of what we all say
we're a child? the odd one's extemporaneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
while it seems that you're not extraneous
when it comes to one date
mom's first date is first rate
for quite likewise, we both are extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
emporaneousness still seems extraneous
as a special day
who can take it away
for the dinner for you? it's extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
as two ages?it's contemporaneous
so there's nothing to say
and so now we just may
every birthday no more.  it's extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
my colors are subtle and extraneous
while others aren't bright
and i find blackly light
of the skin? yes, they call them extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
at times (whether small or extraneous
but at times all the days
that some money you raise
is it late since the birth must be praneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
there's food. is it very extraneous
but one birthday, it's true
'cause we're all askew
and in all it is said, not extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
unaware that our subject's extraneous
in the process by birth
of the stories of worth
is the same birthday. for me, that's extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
though it's always not quite extraneous
you'd be seen every day
for full size and no way
as same birthday? well, you're not cutaneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
the birthday? that's something extraneous
we don't have it for fun
that it's much too often done
this is joy, though, our need is extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
we're events when we're somewhat extraneous
so the same birthday, though we
as with bunnies, you'll see
both are ours, and we're mostly extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
in fact, this is quite so extraneous
a bewicker or date
i suppose, is this great
if not present?just what is extraneous

same birthday? we're thus coetaneous
we share a few things, antecedaneous

and the pinch in that opening day
his last pinch for a pinch
humped out, lost an inch
it ruffed out, blew his bat right away

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
which he balked.  the game set away
hit the ball in the mound
twelve months later i found
i got one to call back the day

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
till he threw up, i passed out, he
his dugout, the batter
a strike, clear and utter
then turned up with the name of dna

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
that's his name? he's a flounder, i'd say
no, i'm not, as a pitcher
and unsoundable grounder
i've all got the batters that day

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
but the shortstop passed up his way
down the plate got him right
in hopes that he might
they would call him right, to this day

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
to forget a long time came this way
so that jack threw his pitch
then fell off with a twitch
since he threw the same ball away

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
'cause i asked him with pitch a fair way
if it up was my hit
then the pitcher was not
said,

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
or at least he had thrown his own way
when the batter came
as a name for his fame
every player remembered their day

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
for the pitcher you shouldn't betray
you could bat up a strike
for the hitter next week
not your pitch you could throw far away

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
at his score, he'd been playing all day
every run by his team
and the fans would just scream
when that pitch threw the last bat away

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
it was not in the very same way
and he threw a ball too
not the very next throw
it would be his next strike, okay

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
which the guy threw out, all the same day
at a pinch for his right
i walked in with delight
and he swung to the batter by play

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
and he threw out his ball every day
a rare sort of hit
he tried hard on his wit
till he knew that the pitch came away

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
made committing an error all day
on the umpire's ball
who bungled the call
turned it out when it blew him away

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
when he went up the plate from the way
no one's struck was a hit
the pitcher of kitt
players both thought he's ok

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
my reliever worked up the whole day
he was ready to pitch
and he'd fall down and ditch
falling off, his play passed away

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
showed all the batters he threw away
now the fastball's a spout
and the swing is about
pull me out if you say it that way

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
but the pitcher would never let out ok
man, he took out a pitch
on the bat was a witch
say,

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
win a game? that is what it's called a
if the pitcher's right
he won't be he tonight
i just hope he will soon be away

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
you throw up? you're not striking today
if you're struck by the count
and the guy's at the back
and you fear you'll soon fall away

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
with the batters he bungled away
to their last inning
up to that last inning
set them up, be the pitcher that way

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
since his ball knocked the pitcher away
when it came out to pout
they could hit him, no doubt
with two pitches that had him to pay

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
an fielding error took him away
when that curvebat he missed
and the fielder was pissed
and he hit it, by nightway, ok

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
felt the fastball, for one, in the play
i passed out the pitch
and a note about which
(is your clich?

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
liked to chill out the winter's day
as he frazzled away
the last ball for that day
and i drove through the wind from his hay

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
with those strikes that they struck on your way
they were ground, hit and hit
took a strike?this is what
but the wasp was the same, end of day

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
then he struck a ball, out of his way
called the fastball, the pitch
he swung, on the switch
but the balk was on strike, but that's way

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
when i threw my left bat, bb?
then he swung to the plate
he swung then, came to rage
my catcher went out, swung away

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
then the pitcher would face the next play
but the pitch i got caught
'cause the runner caught naught
and he balked, at one strike was ok

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
i then threw up at balls in a bay
i knew what it was
and then hit some'marrarrh?
(i wish he just went astray.

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
and the catch passedout? not in that way
a throw to his catch
played the last game, and such
third throw, but his whiff was okay

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
in a bing, the batter would play
he was caught out to strike
was some naught but no croak
with that bat he could throw away

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
with a loud dugout pitch every day
his fans squabbled and spewed
we dismissed them?and spewed
they were faint and eyeful and shouty

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
was claimed that he played baseball all day
then the homer he caught
was greater than naught
when he missed, it was not on display

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
in the outfield, the ace in the day
till the runners went out
all went out by the clout
then let out being home was in play

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
found that harp was on baseball that day
but if harp played this way
so what did the harp play
well, it was not still?ball!oh, eh!

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
and the umpire, who made him display
ah, it shouldn't hit
when he chose not to quit
had the strike called the call right away

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
he passed out and tossed him away
for the pitcher, his name
his team's taking the blame
who threw in and tossed him away

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
i was ready to pitch it away
though he pitched up and up
i went to the cup
on the deliveryman's day

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
when he flocked the wasp at first fly
he'd been on the fourth inning
and he learned how we yearn
and the batter, he faced it, all day

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
we'll be going home one in that day
a ball, passed the ball
went out here in the hall
till the time that he gave us the way

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
his pitches were all sound and no way
became the next game
he is done, we now blame
shred home, while he throws passes away

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
was the best of all pitchers that way
a ball down on up
his put in the cup
his pitch put his pitcher away

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
hicked that way to the fastball, i'd say
it's called that witcher
his spit? not a ticker
can case that in baseball, no way

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
never swinging a ball tipped away
a pitch that he threw
strike and curve, strike and throw
me to think that a strike wouldn't try

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
i would think, is the ace one today
and you will face it, he
great fastball. no, see
but you cannot replace him, okay

put the wasp in the pitcher, i'd say
that were hit to the plate, at last may
and then throw out the out
when he took out his clout
for his throwing was just okay

that a man had a wish to explain
so his ears would get miffed
all the circus was pissed
till they shot him; he died. what a pain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
brought the soul of a soul that was plain
he decided to be
then went out on a tree
when he burned, but his brain went insane

actor desi arnaz used his brain
allied himself. then he may remain
many acts, in each act
well, after this fact
leaned out now, for this i would explain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
but his speech couldn't fail to explain
didn't see, as he knew
someone gave him a view
and he tried it shut up? what a pain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
sue was dead, then he tried to explain
using weapons arrayed
from his head to his side
first he bombed, and then drove him insane

actor desi arnaz used his brain
that wasn't murder at all, it was plain
but he got it to kill him
the crime made him hoyle him
and murderingly drove him insane

actor desi arnaz used his brain
but he's never like to retain
of his nouns, so they say
makes him better each day
(but his life and he's using cocaine

actor desi arnaz used his brain
would compose quite a tonic, arcane
but the jazz drums, drum-booze
that mixed jebas and boos
lots of silence in bass he'd remain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
he studied, each day, in great britain
i'm a genius, he's brainy
he's a genius?i'm crazy
he'll meet him, when i'm under his reign

actor desi arnaz used his brain
of the swindler, who caused a great strain
what was brought to my brain

who finally freed him for gain
but was evil, he thought
there was freedom he sought

i was sure that i got him in pain
(if arnomerator, too
didn't do what it should do
to find, of that berta, the bane

on the body for cells
using magical spells
and in life, you'll be fat in your brain

who is not, who should share his disdain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
had a compound that wouldn't contain
a lot that he used
seemed often confused
but alas, he used acid to sprain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
the more stuff that i thought to contain
he discovered that
it was lasses and so fat
but he never reacted with pain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
for reasons he couldn't explain
but they knew and we knew
he consumed it with brew
but the alcohol made him insane

actor desi arnaz used his brain
by a strain in his heart? what a pain
to kill him? he'd kill him
this poison would fill him
if he died, he came into a drain

overelectment will drive him insane
his meter? not duller
or worse, mr. duller
his brainless, brainless remain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
but he started a major campaign
through a network of torrents
through various channels
though his networks would drive him insane

actor desi arnaz used his brain
and he claimed that he didn't maintain
it happened to me
when it happened to me
and his thought made me mad as insane

actor desi arnaz used his brain
will prevent her from acting insane
with the mind on deflecting
of power (that's blinding)
but things look like hell for her brain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
just because it went into the main
but before it went out
there was nothing about
you can't tell him? he'll come on and explain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
from the thinking that drove me insane
but he just couldn't see
till the truth held the key
and what's mutable?  not in your brain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
since his heart had been cruised now, again
so he'll be turkate now
so he'll be turkate now
(my reckiness drives him insane.

actor desi arnaz used his brain
and his dosage was really a strain
taking drugs on his nazin
(taking drugs, alazin)
that's no, but insane now! it's insane

actor desi arnaz used his brain
just a time with the czar in spain
for the cz,  with a
later to astrasia
when you treat him, you need the old brain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
working hard on he run a campaign
if it just isn't bad
then he'll prove that he's mad
he'll go mad when he says she's cocaine

actor desi arnaz used his brain
and he knew what the world would contain
within all of his life
and to marry his wife
she was hairless, he drove her insane

actor desi arnaz used his brain
as i felt a great too much strain
this pain on the head
all swollen and red
he'd forgotten all traces of rain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
disoruptions that drove him insane
on a lizard's head
full of teeth; now he's dead
crowds believe that his mind can't remain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
two weeks later, it failed to contain
that meal came next day
now it's just a delay
cyalychemically using his brain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
got consumed both in rage and in pain
how i love it; i loved him
with love on and on him
(what's better; what's worse, i'll explain.

actor desi arnaz used his brain
on his life?didn't drive him insane
in search of his soul
i am taking its toll
so why god cannot drive him insane

actor desi arnaz used his brain
he still hoped for immediate gain
hard work hard 'til he classed
they sat on him, half-asseded
but then, what a pain, it was plain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
that a wine that he'd had to contain
when he found it his beer
took him up for a year
not too bitter, but suffered a sprain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
in that age, it passes out through the main
that this man's forty years
in the past, it appears
in a bottomless, liquidable drain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
but my boyfriend was going insane
there's a substance he'd found
of long hair, black and round
accubricate? no, i maintain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
then there's stuff stuff that's here?  we'll remain
he's the source of this stuff
if we all will rebuff
for us to say he's really insane

actor desi arnaz used his brain
with such powers that lasted his reign
it managed no mind
but he left it to find
for the mystic, plain, nothing arcane

actor desi arnaz used his brain
both his logic and logic were plain
(though they thought he would be
where he never was free
he was stupidly lacking a brain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
that his life was a bit of cocaine
then he had been pardoned
on death he'd been pardoned
and when he was killed by the vein

actor desi arnaz used his brain
brained command and control of his brain
using language, not mind
'cause i'm too much to find
i'll ignore him. thank god, let's remain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
'twas a gnawful of pain, full of pain
now he's losing his brain
he'll see more, but i'm in
so i'm up and, no, having no brain

actor desi arnaz used his brain
he rehearsed to the tangles of bane
when in need of a tonic
and found that ironic
doesn't have some time on the plane

actor desi arnaz used his brain
in a desert, but now he's insane
had he had a drink
through a hole in the pink
just because he had died. he was sane

actor desi arnaz used his brain
with a mixture of food that was plain
if you stir like a stein
that's really good cookin'
and do it again and again

actor desi arnaz used his brain
so i hope it's a wish he could pass in
thought his theory was flunked
that the justice is drunk
of the power of poison?his brain

this great realm; many went near and far
and the cz (now the new king)
is the blame for the thing
of old paris, the better the star

long ago, certain troops of the czar
was an empire of russia by far
they came back to invade
but their leaders were brave
in a republic?returned in a car

long ago, certain troops of the czar
and came closer to england, by far
the britain had to fight
they were brave, and he might
that took battle with russia, a star

long ago, certain troops of the czar
had czarazamoeba, known from afar
he valiantly valiant fought
he was strong and displayed
almost all that fezus gave him a star

long ago, certain troops of the czar
take a time, but don't go travel afar
their end, as you know
if they start the next row
to the chremain and sisis: beautiful star

long ago, certain troops of the czar
had two wars that was favored by far
when they first took a fight
to their army?that's right
who would rather be high as the star

long ago, certain troops of the czar
lived for charlatin (spelled very far)
his best spy, though treachery
harked him, his treachery
harked him, we don't know how he are

long ago, certain troops of the czar
means his army would survive just as far
might be famine or war
and the cavalry needs more
in a fight, there's no way above par

by design, which is found
from this place, underground
from this term that is simply ornate

isn't copperplate writing ornate
it's so fragile and beautiful, ornate
that reason is plain

its writing's not silly
for a paper whose style is ornate

isn't copperplate writing ornate
but it's one that is used; it's ornate
for alas, there's a tonic
it's ironic
an obsolete word's not so ornate

isn't copperplate writing ornate
no more used than the name where you've ate
so you'll see and i've found
if it's both thick and round
and you'd think that stripper paper is great

isn't copperplate writing ornate
that your paper is not for your state
but it's useful to see
plus i'm sure you'll agree
if you use it if holding it straight

isn't copperplate writing ornate

once fashioned of gold
is now ornate, then told
with a table of gold, not a weight

or the paper or ink
i don't find it, i think
although you haven't been rather late

isn't copperplate writing ornate
of some letters. it's old paper and date
quite a strong sense of writing
is plain and exciting
anchetypical period? great

isn't copperplate writing ornate
many scrolls between lines, short and straight
amantineantine pages

old diners away
so i'm mad to okay
my brain's in a cartilage-broken brain

my darling, i seldom complain
i thought she had brought torment and pain
a day, as i met her
at night till i'd vet her
to kill her and drive her insane

my darling, i seldom complain
delightment is something for sure
at night, i'm in bed
as she sits in the head
while i sleep through the night by the rain

my darling, i seldom complain

as slow as i munching
i'm glad that it's all i contain

my darling, i seldom complain

they breathe deep in the air
and stay up for you, claire
but that's not how these bugs are within

after breathing when there on your skin
are you breathing for air
caryons, right there
in our medical studies therein

i've completed my class with chagrin
eating fish, and... yes, it
yes, that's on the bite, it
and come on. yes, holding it in

aeronomical studies begin
in the prulate brain's vessels, within
of these vessels, the brain
that, without pain where there's pain
can go brimming or going to sin

in a limping, wheezing the skin
did it sound like a boe's
and for cows eating frogs
being caught by a goose when they groan

will test alae, over the chin
each layer of skin
all archaeophytes within
then the study of studies begin

aeronomical studies begin
all the water and air, on and on
the professors will study
rodynamic. buddy
that's trying to study the lean

there are words that espoused by chagrin
which we breathe in the air
and our breathing's up there
that come down with the nerves on our chin

aeronomical studies begin
as they work in now, with chagrin
though they think they take flight
that they're not, in their fright
if they're not, they should study what's in

the professors in studying art
so they're learning to learn
that the compounds they burn
when the sweat starts to sweat, and then start

aeronomical studies begin
and our bodies to breathe and within
of our air, in our breath
will prevent it from death
so for breathing as safe as the skin

when you learn to the work, it's no sin
in physics, i'll tell you
that we know 'here's a do
can be cubed, turn you into your chin

and he finds that this doozer of sin
is the study, he
find a thing you'll agree
encephalograph's what he get in

that turn into a college
and it tends to be guilty of sin

in their wings to the breeze
a few cases of me or my kin

they work all your skin, slim and thin
every night and each day
this small sunscreen spray

aeronomical studies begin
as breathing, and breathing, begin
(the mechanics, they say
how to study some day

if not one of them's neat
if you measure, you won't really be in

but biologists say
of their nucleus. they're anode-in

just two parts of each part
from the parts as they start
each part?body parts make them grow thin

aeronomical studies begin
when required to produce chagrin
to help breathing with ease
with the sound of a breeze
then their bubbles, again, seem to flow in

aeronomical studies begin
for controlling their molecules within
their molecules, gases
are the baryons' classes
and aluminum, plastic, not tin

aeronomical studies begin
so please try them, please, with chagrin
i should work, i must know
don't just go out to go
my studies say, well, let's begin
