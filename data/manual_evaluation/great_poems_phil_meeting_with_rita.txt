do the girls in our sorority swoon
if they fall, we'll go down 'round the moon
every night, will they wait
and then sneak off their mate
there are women at work as a boon

the man's a very good cook. I swear;
yes, his tenaciousness nothing can bear.
he's a load of fine food
for the guy who's all stewed,
he'll admit it. I'll tell him, with flair.

his psalms aren't easy to hear.
full of music is sweet in the ear.
to the soprano's soft voice
makes the singers rejoice,
should we hear it beguile and cheer?

a pirate who isn't quite the swell
wants to claim that he's tied to a spell.
what's right? here's the reason:
it's hurricane season.
he's king, we'll be going to hell.

I thought you'd agree it was funny
that the weather was pretty and sunny.
but they loved weathers fair,
every one and me there
the whole season was snowy and rainy.

to a fellow with a fondness for fish,
he likes to bring food on a dish.
when he's laid on your table,
you'll find that you're able
to eat on himself, if you wish.

my wife and son don't like to share;
I ask it and give it right there.
we'll argue all day
whatever they say
they'll be heard when the law will be fair.

I was hit by a car (terrific news)
and I crashed with a way too much booze.
and my fault in the crash
was another car's crash?
I have brakes now, no brake for my shoes!

I'm a cross-dresser; I'm known to wear heels
but I speak of a style that appeals
a young woman, it's true
and I haven't a clue
don't tell me! I'm no want to bear heels

do you like to play jazz for a fee
playing limericks like music, you see
maybe snuggle up, dance
in that party, askance
while alone there, you'll surely agree

an unfortunate fellow named marge
because he was caught in law's charge
he'd caught out on the law
claimed he hadn't a flaw

if you want to make your own bread
add some jam and some candies instead
yes, its texture and taste
without going to waste
if at breakfast you serve with this spread

our society is filled with extremes
we are striving for most of our dreams
we are filled with oration
with the cause of inflation
consumerism: we add to its themes

I've got money that I want to invest
and I've found my investment was best:
I ran off with my cash?
this decision was rash.
took it last, 'cause my wife is distressed.

if a guy says his girl can't be had,
his reaction's paradoxically bad.
if he thinks she's so bitchy,
she's not just his beauty,
so perhaps it's unbearably sad.

that's a fact, not a fiction
when women encounter some friction
the end of romance
is a slip of their pants
does it lead to good manners and diction

I like veggies and salads, fresh fish.
so here's salad and eat
take me home. take a seat!

I adore him; it's worthy to mention.
now that man's in my head?
what if I'm in my bed?
I got it! just broke the convention.

this limerick's a delight:
though it rhymes with lines nice and tight.
when I write something funny,
I choose something runny.
(in limericks, I don't like to write.)

the doctor decided to mellow

I'll compose limericks that are fun
though the work of their own, so I run
the five lines I write
are the last line in sight
all the limericks, which I'll have to be fun
