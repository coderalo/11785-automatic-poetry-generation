# Data

## Preprocessing
The preprocessing folder contains the `get_data` notebook to get, clean up, and partition the OEDILF dataset, preparing it as a training dataset for fine-tuning GPT-2.
- `limericks.json`: OEDILF limericks

## Raw
The raw folder contains generated limericks not yet post-processed or evaluated.
- `free_form.txt` is generated by simply inputing <BOS> token
-- generated using standard LM as the reverse LM tends to directly output the first <LINE> immediately after <BOS>

- `free_form_5000.txt` is generated by simply inputting <BOS> token
-- generate first line using standard LM and then rest of limerick using reverse LM

- `once_upon_a_time.txt` is generated by inputting the first line "once a upon a time <LINE>"

- `sample.txt` is generated by using the first line from 100 sampled limericks, generating 50 new limericks for each line.
-- The actual number of limericks may be slightly off, as the model can sometimes generate limericks that do not have 5 lines (it's relatively rare though)

## Classification
The classification folder contains both OEDILF and generated poems that were put through the post-processing stages, including (1) grammar correction, (2) lexical diversity calculations, (3) content classification, and (4) noun embedding distances (WordNet and BERT).
- `oedilf_ld_class_72432.json`: contains the full OEDILF dataset with lexical diversity metrics and content classification
- `04_21_free_form_spell_checked_12832_ld_10702_class_5504_metrics_5473_allmetrics.json` contains the final set of classified generated free form limericks with all metric evaluations

## Manual Evaluation
- `rank.py`: python tool that can be run in terminal to conduct manual evaluations over generated poems
- `04_25_all_evaluated.json`: the final set of free form poems with all evaluation metrics, including manual evaluation rankings
