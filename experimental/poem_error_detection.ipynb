        "# Experimental feature: Detecting grammar errors in poems and assigning a penalty score\n",
        "Philipp, March 28th 2022\n",
        "\n",
        "There is a tool called LanguageServer, which is a grammar checker implemented in Java. It's used for example in the OpenOffice suite. language_tool_python (https://github.com/jxmorris12/language_tool_python) is a wrapper around that tool. It can be installed and imported, and starts a local LanguageTool server instance when instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        "I implemented a couple of functions that check lines of a poem for errors. Some matches represent trivial errors, e.g. lower case line beginning or lower case i (should this maybe be an actual error?), so I added some functionality to filter those matches out.\n",
        "\n",
        "I also propose to have some kind of error-to-penalty mapping where different grammar errors get assigned different weights so that we can have poems that are \"more wrong\" than others, but maybe just filtering out erroneous poems will be enough. \n",
